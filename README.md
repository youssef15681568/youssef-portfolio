# youssef-portfolio
This is a simple portfolio of mine to show my skill and what I can do, the website in it self is built using modern web-dev tech, like React-JS for the front end functionality, tailwind-css for styling, and also I used google firebase for the backend to handle the operation and functionality of the contact form.
